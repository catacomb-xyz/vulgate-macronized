Praise in the way of a canticle. For David himself, on the day before the sabbath, wthen the earth was founded. The Lord hath reigned, he is clothed with beauty; the Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded himself. For he hath established the world which shall not be moved.
My throne is prepared from of old; thou art from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods have lifted up their waves,
with the noise of many waters. Wonderful are the exaltations of the sea; wonderful is the Lord on high.
Thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible; holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.
