Praise of a canticle for David himself. Come, let us praise the Lord with joy; let us joyfully sing to God our saviour;
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; and make a joyful noise to him with psalms;
for the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
For in his hand are all the ends of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are his;
for the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
Come, let us adore and fall down, and weep before the Lord that made us;
for he is the Lord our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.
To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts,
as in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the wilderness; where your fathers tempted me, they proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I offended with that generation, and I said: These always err in heart.
And these men have not known my ways; so I swore in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest.
