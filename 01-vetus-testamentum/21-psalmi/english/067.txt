O mountain of God, fat mountain; O curdled mountain, fat mountain.
Why suspect, ye curdled mountains? A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell; for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.
The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands, thousands of them that rejoice; the Lord is among them in Sina, in the holy place.
Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou hast received gifts in men; yea for those also that do not believe, the dwelling of the Lord God.
Blessed be the Lord day by day; the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us.
Our God is the God of salvation; and of the Lord, of the Lord are the ways out from death.
But God shall break the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of them that walk on in their sins.

From thy temple in Jerusalem, kings shall offer presents to thee.
Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds; the congregation of bulls with the cows of the people, who seek to exclude them who are tried with silver. Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars.
Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.
Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth; sing ye to the Lord; Sing ye to God,
Who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, to the east; behold he will give to his voice the voice of power.
Give ye glory to God for Israel; his magnificence and his power is in the clouds.
God is wonderful in his saints; the God of Israel is he who will give power and strength to his people. Blessed be God.
