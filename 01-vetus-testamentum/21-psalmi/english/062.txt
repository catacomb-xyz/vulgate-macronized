A psalm of David while he was in the desert of Edom.
O God, my God, to thee from the dawn do I keep watch. My soul hath thirsted for thee; how many ways to thee my flesh.
In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water: so in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.
For thy mercy is better than lives; thee my lips will praise.
Thus I will bless thee all my life long, and in thy name I will lift up my hands.
Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in the morning.
Because thou hast been my helper, and I will rejoice under the cover of thy wings.
My soul hath stuck close to thee: thy right hand hath received me.
But they have sought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth;
they shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes.
But the king shall rejoice in God; all they shall be praised that swear by him, because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.
