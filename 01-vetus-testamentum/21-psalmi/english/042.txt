A psalm for David. Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from the nation that is not holy: deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man.
For thou art, O God, my strength; why hast thou cast me off? And why do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me?
Send forth thy light and thy truth; these have conducted me, and brought me unto thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles.
And I will go in to the altar of God, to God who giveth joy to my youth. To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp.
Why art thou sad, O my soul? And why dost thou disquiet me?
Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
