Unto the end, a psalm for David, to bring to remembrance that the Lord saved him.
O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me.
Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul.
Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire evils to me; let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me: Well done, well done.
Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, those who love thy salvation.
But I am needy and poor; O God, help me. Thou art my helper and my deliverer; O Lord, make no delay.
